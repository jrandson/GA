This is a simple Genetic Algorithm developed in language C.

To use it you can set basic configurations such as size of the population, rate of mutation and crossover. Moreover you can define the precision of
the GA by choosing the type of the Integer which represents the best chromossome.

The elite population is compounded just by one agente, which is the best chromossomo of each poplation

Choose the function you want to minimize in the method feval.

obs: this algoritm, by default aways looks for a minimum of the objective function
