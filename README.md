This is a simple Genetic Algorithm developed in language C.

To use it you can set baseic configuraions such as size of the population, rate of mutation and crossover. Morove you can define the precision of
the GA by choosing the type of the integer which represents the chromossome.

The elite population is compound just by one agente, which is the best chromossomo of each poplation

Choose the function you want minimize in the method feval.

obs: this algoritm, by default aways looks for a minimum of the objective function
